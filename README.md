# SlopShield

Consuming anything online is a constant struggle to filter quality from clickbait - a quiet battle between you and the creators and algorithms trying to make few extra cents per click, your attention is all they need.

Degenerative AI has aggressively tipped that battle: mass-producing low-quality slop that's indistinguishable from real content is now nearly effortless.

**This is an attempt to fight back.**

Instead of using AI to generate yet more content nobody asked for, it points the model the other way - letting it chew through the endless feed of garbage so you don't have to. Every video on your YouTube homepage gets a 0-100 bullshit score and a one-sentence summary of what's actually inside, judged from the transcript.

A content-level firewall for the asymmetric battle against unsolicited slop.

## The scale

The score measures how badly a video breaks the promise its title makes.

| Score | Verdict | |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 0-20 | **LEGIT** | does what the title says |
| 21-40 | **MILD** | delivers, with some rambling |
| 41-60 | **MEH** | there's real content in there, buried in padding |
| 61-80 | **BAIT** | promises a lot more than it delivers |
| 81-100 | **SLOP** | filler stretched out for watch time |

## Setup

1. [Install from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/slopshield/phenlaclgbeidgdnacjlcjajljdkbhif) (or load this folder unpacked via `chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked**).
2. Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), or [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) - or use any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, OpenRouter, Groq, vLLM).
3. Click the SlopShield icon, pick a provider, paste the key, **Save & test**.
4. Reload youtube.com.

## Notes

Scoring costs about $0.001-0.002 per video with the default models. Videos go out batched 4 per request and scores are cached for 30 days, so a homepage of ~30 videos costs a few cents, once. Against a local Ollama it's free.

There's no server. Your browser pulls the transcript from YouTube's player API and sends it to the provider you picked, with your key. That's the entire data path.

NO CAPTIONS on a tile means there was no transcript to judge (fresh uploads, live streams, age-restricted videos). ERROR is usually temporary and retries on its own.
